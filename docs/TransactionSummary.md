# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of TransactionSummary from a JSON string
transaction_summary_instance = TransactionSummary.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(TransactionSummary.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
transaction_summary_dict = transaction_summary_instance.to_dict()
