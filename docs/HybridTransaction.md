```python
from ynab.models.hybrid_transaction import HybridTransaction

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of HybridTransaction from a JSON string
hybrid_transaction_instance = HybridTransaction.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(HybridTransaction.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
hybrid_transaction_dict = hybrid_transaction_instance.to_dict()
